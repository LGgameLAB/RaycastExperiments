    I can't find peace, and have no war to wage;
    I fear and hope, I blaze and I'm like ice;
    I fly higher than the sky and I lie on the ground;
    I clasp nothing, and I embrace the whole world.

    I'm kept a prisoner by one who neither opens nor locks my cell;
    She neither claims me for her own, nor loosens my bonds;
    Love neither kills me nor undoes my chains;
    He doesnt want me to live, but doesn't remove my distress,

    I see without eyes; I have no tongue and I clamor
    I yearn to perish, and I call for aid; I
    I loathe myself and I love another:

    I feed on sorrow, as I weep I laugh;
    I'm equally displeased with death and life,
    I'm in this condition, my lady, on your account
